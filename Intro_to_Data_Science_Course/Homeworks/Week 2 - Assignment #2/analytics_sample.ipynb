    "4. to remove the hidden __pycache__ run this line in the terminal (if you have trouble accessing the terminal via JupyterHub. Go to Week 1 Lecture. There is information there telling you how to open the terminal at the end of the pdf slides and the beginning of the ipynb lecture. Useful commands in the terminal:\n",

In README.md, there are alternative instructions with how to present your homework (i.e., try out the function you write in the if name == \"main,\" instead of here in the analytic notebook. You can do either, but I like the ipynb approach (it is more annoying with the need to remove __pycache__ though).\n",
