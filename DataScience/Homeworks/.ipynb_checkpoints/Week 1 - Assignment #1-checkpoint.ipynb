    "    * This assignment's purpose is to show the relationships between data samples and their populations. Using the given dataset as the population data, you will perform a series of tasks that allow you to learn the dos and don'ts of data collections. \n",

    "* __Background__:\n",
    "    * In the real world, Data Scientists often do not have control over the data collection process. Most of the time, their analytical journey starts with a given dataset. Errors in data collections may cripple the Data Scientists' abilities before they even begin the work. With a correct understanding of the right way to collect data, you will be able to help design the data collection process and more likely to detect data collection errors. \n",
